First test: “python myclient.py www.google.com 80 GET /”

I believe this test is a success because it retrieves a “200 OK” response and an entire HTML document.


Second test: “python myclient.py 127.0.1.1 8888 GET /”
AND
			“python myserver.py 8888

This test is suppose to send a request to the server and return “Hello World” to the client.






Third test: “python myclient.py 127.0.1.1 8888 GET putdata/temp.txt”
AND
			“python myserver.py 8888

This test proves the path resolution functions correctly and the server can process a GET request and send a file to the client


Fourth test: “python myclient.py 127.0.1.1 8888 PUT temp.txt”
AND
			“python myserver.py 8888

This test proves the PUT request can transfer a file to the server. The putdata/temp.txt file is removed before this test is executed to prove it works correctly
